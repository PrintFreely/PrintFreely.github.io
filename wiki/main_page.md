# Welcome to PrintFreely!
### We are a community meant to attack Big Printer.
## Reason
We want to free the people from printer companies that produce faulty devices, use terrible DRM, monger fear about third-party stuff (Remanufactured Ink/toner, etc.), Restrict the people, etc.
PrintFreely is of the people, by the people, and for the people. 
Printers should be liberated.
